Description:
This package enables users to run a multi-path selection algorithm for linear and logistic models. This ability is granted with the following four functions:
   build_paths()
Builds models based on the best family AIC.
   stability()
Calculates the stability of given models.
   plausible_models()
Determines usable models based on AIC and stability.
   confusion_metrics()
Provides a confusion matrix for logistic models.
